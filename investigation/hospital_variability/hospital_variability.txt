Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

I still use the Timely and Effective Care data set. I check all checking categories which sames as process of hospital quality question,  Emergency Department, Surgical Care Improvement Project, and so on.  
Since there are multiple way to check the variability, standard deviation is the way I choose to answer this question and it is really efficient. 
As the table shows below, the highest variablilty is EMR(Emergency Dempartment) and the lowest variability is Surgical Care Improvement Project  

EMR	37.7654203533417
SCI	1.3191935869825644
ASTH	12.719121104332116
HF	3.1029389457336127
SC	5.149481390107596
