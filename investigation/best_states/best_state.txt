What states are models of high-quality care?


I use the same process as the checking high quality care by hospital, the only thing I change is I sort by states and check the average scores for both table. 

The top 10 state who have best average scores based on timely and effective care are from OK(32.6) to OR(27.8). 

 
OK		32.6
PR		31.8
MS		31.4
NE		30.0
LA		30.0
AR		28.8
DC		28.2
MN		28.0
AL		27.8
OR		27.8
