Are average scores for hospital quality correlated with patient survey responses?

I used the data from ¡°surv_resp_info¡± table and based on the correlation formula 
cor(X,Y)=cov(X,Y)/sd(X)sd(Y)

Finally, I calculate the correlation foe each checking categories related survey response data 

As the table shows below, the survey responses have a negative correlation relationship.
However, there are some outliers in this table which I created. Most categories follow the rules I found above, 
but for Discharge and Dimension and Total Improvement do not have strong relationship with the survey response. 
Therefore, the final answer is mostly, the survey response have correlation relationship with the hospital quality and we can say that, 
better hospital quality have better survey response which means patients are more likely to build interation with good quality hospitals.
