What hospitals are models of high-quality care?

To answers, I choose Timely and Effective Care table to start my analysis. It stored and named ¡°time_effec_info¡± table in the system. Basically, I choose to compare the Timely and Effective Care data with the Readmissions and Deaths data which was stored and named into the read_deaths_info table. The key things is to check each categories average scores and rank them to get the best high-quality care - average scores.

These categories are: Emergency Department, Surgical Care Improvement Project, Children¡¯s Asthma, Heart Failure, Stroke Care, Pneumonia, Preventive Care, Blood Clot Prevention and Treatment, Heart Attack or Chest Pain, and Pregnancy and Delivery Care. I create code to check all categories average scores by each hospital.

In addition, I calculate the average rankings for each hospital across all categories in a descending way. I list top 10 best high quality care hospital which from WESLEY MEDICAL CENTER (average score 25.7) to NOVANT HEALTH ROWAN MEDICAL CENTER (average score 10.9).
 
In addition, based on class discussion with the study groups, I decide to check the readmission and death rate to see if there are some deviations. The total average score of entire Readmission and Death Score are 14.0. These top 10 hospitals average scores are close to 14.0 and it is way much further than the minimum score (1.6). Therefore, I have strong confidence that my result is favorable to answer this question
