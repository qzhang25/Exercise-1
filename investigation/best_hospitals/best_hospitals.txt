What hospitals are models of high-quality care?

I use time and effective data to analysis this question.  The key things is to check each categories average scores and rank them to get the best high-quality care - average scores.

There are many key checking categories which have huge impact to review hospital rank such as Emergency Department, Surgical Care Improvement Project, Childrenâ€™s Asthma, Heart Failure, Stroke Care,,etc.. Therefore, I choose to check all these atetories and get the averages score among these categories and rank them to get the top 10 list result.

As the table blow shows: Maricopa Medical center have the highest score which means is the best quality hospital.
