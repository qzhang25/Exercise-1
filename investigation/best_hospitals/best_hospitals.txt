What hospitals are models of high-quality care?

I use time and effective data to analysis this question.  The key things is to check categories average scores and rank them to get the best high-quality care - average scores. There are many categories need to check, but in my opinion I decided to check the major categories Emergency Department, Heart Failure, Surgical Care, Childrenâ€™s Asthma and Stroke Care to analysis the average score for this  categories.


As the table blow shows: BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL has the highest score which means is the best quality hospital.
